An analysis of a pharmaceutical study that compares the results of several different treatment regiments.  Presented within a Jupyter Notebook with data visualizations built using pandas and Matplotlib.

## Description

As a senior data analyst at a hypothetical pharmaceutical company, Pymaceuticals, I've been tasked with analyzing the results of a study that compared the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against other treatment regimens.  In this study, 249 mice with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) tumors were treated with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development within these mice was observed and measured.

Having been provided the tumor measurements made over the 45-day time period as well attribute information for each of the mice involved in the study, I have aggregated the data to showcase topline summary statistics of the study as well as a variety of data visualizations aimed at comparing and analyzing the impact of the different drug regimens upon tumor development.

Leveraging a Jupyter Notebook, Python, pandas, and Matplotlib, I have analyzed and organized the data so that it highlights the following:

* Summary statistics of each drug regimen tested
* Bar chart of total observations measured by drug regimen
* Pie chart of the gender composition of the studied mice
* Boxplots comparing the average final tumor volume observed in the 4 most promising treatments
* Line plot tracking the tumor volume of one test subject treated with Capomulin over time
* Scatter Plot testing a possible correlation between measured tumor volume and mouse weight (Capomulin regimen only)

### Dependencies

The latest version of Python, pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook must be installed in order to run the files.
The following .csv files are required (stored in 'Resources' folder):
* Mouse_metadata.csv
* Study_results.csv
